# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-Challenge

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against an AI opponent. The AI uses a simple algorithm to determine its moves - it first checks if it can win in the current turn, then checks if the player can win in the next turn and blocks, and finally makes a random move if neither of those conditions are met. The game continues until either the player or the AI wins, or the board is full and the game ends in a tie.
